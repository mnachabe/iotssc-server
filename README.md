# iotssc-server
This repo is part of my IOTSSC university project. The task was to achieve indoor localization. Using different variations of the trilateration algorithm, this project was realized and deployed on Google Cloud Platform. 
This repo showcases the server side of the project, which was written in Java. The Spring boot framework played a major part in this project as it was responsible for handling HTTP requests and forwarding them to a service for further computations.
